# Genomic Interpretability

Minimal project skeleton for exploring interpretability methods on genomic sequence models (e.g., attribution, motif discovery, and embedding-based analyses). This repository will be used to organize data, experiments, and evaluation artifacts in a lightweight, reproducible way before adding any model or training logic.
